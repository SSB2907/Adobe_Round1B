It could be a paper form or PDF that hasn’t been optimized for form filling. The Fill & Sign tool automatically detects the form fields like text fields, comb fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons. You can manually add text and other symbols anywhere on the form using the Fill & Sign tool if required. You can complete the forms by entering information and adding your signatures.

      "refined_text": "This mode provides simplified authoring with the capability of assigning fields to multiple signers. When you select a signer from the right pane and add fields in the form, the fields are assigned to the signer. That means those fields will be available to the signer for filling the information and signing the form. • You can switch the assignee of any field using the floating toolbar. The assigned colors to the signers make it easy to distinguish the fields for respective signers. • Advanced mode for multiple signers If you've added multiple signers, you see the options as shown below. Click the button to place the detected form fields in the PDF document. Alternatively, drag fields from the tabs in the right pane and drop the fields where desired in the document. Note: You can switch between simplified mode and advanced mode for multiple signers. To switch mode, turn off the Advanced Editing switch in the right-pane. 6. When you've placed all desired fields in the document, click Send . The document is sent for signature to the recipients and a confirmation notice is displayed. You receive an email from Acrobat Sign stating that the agreements have been sent to the first signer for signature. The first signer also receives an email with a link to sign the agreement. When the signer adds his or her signature in the signature field and then clicks the Click to sign button, the agreement is sent to the next signer with a link to sign, and so on. Once the agreement is signed by all the signers, everyone gets a copy of the signed agreement. All your signed documents are kept at one place and you can access them from anywhere.",

Or, they intentionally design a form that you can fill in only by hand or with the Fill & Sign tool. These non-interactive forms are called flat forms. Fill in interactive forms An interactive form contains fields that you can select or fill in. 1. If necessary, select either the Hand Tool or the Select Tool from the context menu of the page (right-click on the page to open the context menu). The pointer changes to a different icon as you move it over a field. For example, the Hand tool changes to an I-beam when you can type text into the form field. Some text fields are dynamic, meaning that they automatically resize to accommodate the amount of data you enter and can span across pages. 2. Select anywhere in the form to access options, such as radio buttons. Select inside a text field to type. Press Tab to move forward or Shift+Tab to move backward. 3. When finished, submit the form to either send the data to a server or create an email to send the data.",

Enter recipient email addresses followed by commas, or copy and paste a list of email addresses into the Email field. 3. Configure participant authentication by clicking the key icon to the right of the participant. • Email is the default authentication method for confirming the identity of each participant and is sufficient to obtain a legal signature in most cases. Password authentication can be added to increase security. When configured, the participant must enter the password before they can interact with the agreement. 4. . (Optional) Add yourself and/or CC'd parties • Click Add me to add yourself as a counter signer. • Click Add cc to add people you want to be copied when the agreement is sent and complete. 5.

Add Agreement Details: • Name your agreement. All agreements generated from the Send in bulk template will have the same agreement name. • Change the default text in the Message field as appropriate. 7.
